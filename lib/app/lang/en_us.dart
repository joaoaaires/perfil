    I have been working in the software development market since 2014, and over that time I have been collecting experiences in different languages ​​and tools. I have specialties in back-end and mobile development.

    I look for new and better ways to do my tasks and create my code. And I'm always ready to receive a review or learn something new. I like to keep my projects organized and always meet deadlines.

    Besides being a developer, I like to play sports like soccer and volleyball, I like to go for a walk when possible. An anime fan, I like the latest releases like Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen. I love to travel and I have already visited the city of Toronto in Canada, and I dream of visiting New York.

    Contact me through social media. :D
